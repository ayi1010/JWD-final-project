This is a simple to-do task manager built for the Generation Australia JWD final project.
This application utilise many components/classes from the [Bootstrap Library.](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)

<h3>Wireframe</h3>
Wireframes were created in [Figma](https://figma.com) to illustrate what the task manager could look like.
Wireframes for both a mobile and desktop version were created to ensure the application is mobile responsive.

The design concept was to go with something that was minimalistic, clean and simple. The focus was on functionality and ease of use for the user.
The colour pallet was also simple with prominent colours used only in call to action areas.
